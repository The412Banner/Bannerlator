/**
 * Gives a prefix a "Tahoma" font family when it has none, on every launch, whatever store the game came from.
 *
 * Wine's dwrite maps Latin text (U+0000-024F) to "Tahoma" as its last-resort family. A prefix without `tahoma.ttf`
 * has no such family, so any DirectWrite client that asks for a font it cannot find ends up asking for Tahoma
 * again. A Chromium / CEF UI (Skia's DirectWrite font manager) then recurses until its UI-thread stack is gone:
 * device-proven with Ubisoft Connect (920 levels, black screen), and any launcher or store front end built on the
 * same stack is exposed to it. Windows ships the font; a prefix whose `tahoma.ttf` is missing does not.
 *
 * The fix is a `"Tahoma"="Arial"` value under `HKCU\Software\Wine\Fonts\Replacements`, which Wine's font code reads
 * when it looks a family up. A prefix that has the real `tahoma.ttf` is left alone ([hasTahomaFont]), and a
 * "Tahoma" replacement of the user's own is kept as it is.

     * file, and a running wineserver would overwrite the change when it saves its own copy.
     *
     * A prefix that has the real font (`drive_c/windows/Fonts/tahoma.ttf` next to [userReg]) costs one file stat and
     * nothing else. Otherwise the common case (the replacement is already there) is one streamed read that stops at the
