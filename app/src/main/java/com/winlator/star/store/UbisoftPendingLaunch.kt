/**
 * The game to start once the Ubisoft Connect setup has finished.
 *
 * The setup is one container session ([com.winlator.star.store.steamscript.InstallScriptExecutor]); when its batch is
 * done the session exits and the app RESTARTS (`AppUtils.restartApplication` ends the process), so an in-memory marker
 * would be gone. The dialog records the shortcut here the moment the setup session has been launched; the library
 * screen that comes back after the restart ([com.winlator.star.ui.screens.ShortcutLauncher.resumePendingRelaunch], the
 * same hook the SteamLite relaunch uses) reads it once, checks that Connect is now in the prefix, and starts the game
 * through the normal launch flow. If Connect is not there the game is not started and the user is told.
 *
 * One shot: the marker is deleted before anything is launched, so nothing can start the game twice or loop. It
 * lives 30 minutes (the setup session's own cap is 15), is dropped by any other launch from the screens, and a marker
 * written by THIS process is never acted on (the setup session may still be running in it): only a restarted app acts.
 * Best-effort: every failure here means "no pending launch", never a crash.
